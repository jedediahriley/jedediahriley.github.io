=======

created with javascript, jquery, html5, and CSS


Known bugs:
-stand button only iterates one time when evaluating the dealers cards. 
-If you press the stand button again another card will be pulled and added to the score. 
-The pop up wrongly disp[lays the winner if another dealer card needs to be drawn
-Any ace pulled after the original 4 cards will not display correctly. (might return a NaN under certain circumstances)
